                <p>
                    I'm a developer with a passion for crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces <br> that
                    merge
                    thoughtful design with solid engineering. I thrive at the intersection <br>of design and
                    development,
                    building experiences that are not only visually striking but also optimized <br>for performance and
                    usability.

                    With 8 rich years of experience in customer service, I’ve had the privilege of working <br> with
                    reputable organizations such as <strong>Smile Communication,ISON Experience, and Globacom.</strong>
                    <br> This journey has
                    deepened my understanding of user needs and equipped me with the skills to meet and <br>
                    exceed expectations with empathy, precision, and timeliness. <br>

                    When I’m not coding or exploring new technologies, you’ll find me watching a sci-fi or adventurous
                    <br>
                    movie with my family, or trying out a new recipe in the kitchen. <br>For me, creativity flows best
                    when
                    balanced with curiosity and joy whether in code, film, or food.
