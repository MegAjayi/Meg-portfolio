🌍 Personal Portfolio – Ajayi Ayoropo Margret
Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This website is designed to introduce me, Ajayi Ayoropo Margret, to the world as a passionate and growing Front-End Engineer. It highlights who I am, my background, and showcases some of the projects I’ve worked on as I continue to build my career in tech.

🎯 Project Purpose
The main goal of this portfolio is to:

Present a professional introduction of myself.

Share my background and journey into tech.

Display some of the front-end projects I have built.

Serve as a foundation for my continued growth and learning as a developer.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is built primarily with front-end technologies, with light integration of back-end concepts where necessary. The tools and technologies used include:

HTML – for structuring the web pages

CSS – for styling and layout

Bootstrap – for responsive design and quick UI components

(Future upgrades may include JavaScript, Git integration, and back-end support)

🚧 Work in Progress
This is a living project and will continue to evolve as I learn new technologies and complete new projects. I’m committed to improving it as I grow in my front-end development journey.
